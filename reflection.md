## Reflection Document

### HTML

I completed all of the exercises here on my own. The exercises were simple and the HTML was basic, but it was a good introduction to some basic types of objects in HTML. All of the exercises were pretty straightforward, and I don't really have enough experience to say if there was anything else that could've had a dedicated exercise this week.

### Accessibility

I completed this exercise by myself. Accessibility is such a broad and varied area, so I'm not sure how any reasonable number of exercises like this would really expand my understanding in any meaningful way without getting bogged down in different types of accessibility, tools, methods, etc. The exercise was helpful overall because it made me look at how elements are implemented and their functionality rather than just their appearence on the page, since a webpage can look identical to another but has completely different functionality and/or no accessibility features. The lectures and using WAVE prepared me enough to do this lab.

### CSS

I was able to complete all but the last two exercises by myself. The biggest issue in this lab for me was that I was unsure of how the different positions affected overlapping and the left, right, top, and bottom values. Overall, I felt that the exercises helped ease me into styling webpages with css. I think having more information about the different ways elements can be influenced would have helped me with this lab.

### Flexbox

I completed this exercise on my own. This lab felt very straightforward, I don't think there was any missing material that could have prepared me for this lab better. I wish there was an exercise for having to change order since it was the only part of the material that wasn't included in this lab. Overall, it felt like a good introduction to using flexboxes.

### CSS Grid

For this lab, I had to look to the solution to figure out the second exercise. I felt like the material hadn't quite prepared me to do the grid areas exercise by the time I tried to tackle it. That being said I think the two exercises covered everything in the lecture materials and helped me understand where/how I might use the grid system.

### Bootstrap

I ended up having to go back to the solutions and videos for all of these exercises. I think the lecture material was enough to know what to do, but the topic was just harder for me to grasp and I ended up struggling a lot. I think as a result of resorting to looking at the solutions for all of these my grasp on bootstrap is still pretty loose. There was no single exercise that stood as as particularly challenging or particularly insightful compared to the rest.

### Javascript

I completed all but two exercises by myself. In general, the exercises felt like the type of coding exercises I did in my intro coding classes, so they were both familiar and I was able to match prior experience from outside of this class to the topic, which helped a lot. I think the material did a good job of covering what we were doing in the exercises. In turn the exercises were built off tasks we were previously doing with only html and css, so they did a good job of teaching me how to use basic javascript in the context of web development.

### Jquery
